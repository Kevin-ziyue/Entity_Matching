# Entity_Matching
This is the final project for CS 4400-X, Spring 2021.

#Task description

  You are given two tables (left table and right table) of electronic products. Each table is from a
different shopping website. Each row in a table represents a product instance. For every pair of
tuples (Li;Rj), where Li is a tuple in the left table and Rj is a tuple in the right table, it is either
a match or a non-match. A pair of tuples is a match is they refer to the same real-world entity.
Three files are provided in data.zip: ltable.csv (the left table), rtable.csv (the right table), and
train.csv (the training set). The training set contains a subset of tuple pairs, where some of them
are matches and some of them are non-matches. The training set has three columns "ltable_id",
"rtable_id", and "label". "label" being 1/0 denotes match/non-match.
The task is to find all remaining matching pairs like (Li,Rj) in the two tables, excluding those
matches already found in the training set.
